	<h1>Aryan Verma</h1>
	<h2>AI beginner|Sophomore undergrad at IIT Guwahati</h2>
	<p>I am an artificial intelligence beginner with interest in deep learning and quantum computing. Currently a sophomore at Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati with major in Electronics and Communication and minor in Computer Science. 
	<br><br>
		I am quite proficient at python programming (adept at Scikit-learn, numpy and pandas; working proficiency in Tensorflow and PyTorch), C++ and Java object oriented programming.
	<br><br>
		I would like to contribute to the research and development of artifcial general intelligence which still seems to be elusive despite much uproar over OpenAI's GPT-2. Currently working on implementing a differentiable neural computer in PyTorch and developing/deploying a research assistant using BERT which can answer queries from an upload and from wikipedia too
